# Express Note-Taker !

This challenge was given by The University of Minnesota Bootcamp 

This application uses javascript, express.js, JSON, and other wonderful tools to build a note taker app.

### This project has the following features: 
*  _JSON_ Data retrieval
*  _Javascript_
*  _HTML_
*  _Express_

### Installation
User should run...
```
npm i
```
inside terminal 

### Usage
To initiate Note-Taker, user can run...
```
npm start
```
in 'Challenge-repo-11' root terminal

### Bugs
* Missing wind in 5 day forecast (at time of submission)---acceptance criteria
* Does not adjust to queried city local time
* Certain _common city_ names wont be directly accessible to the user, as they are spelled too similarly. (Nashville, Tennessee and Nashville, Indiana)

### Extra add-ons

###### I enjoy adding quality of life (qol) functions to assignments, time permitting. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to bring them to life on this assignment.
