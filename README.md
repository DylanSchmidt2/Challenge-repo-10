# Team Profile Generator !

This challenge was given by _The University of Minnesota Bootcamp_ 

This application utilizes Javascript, Node, Jest, HTML and more, to create a CLA that generates profiles for new employees

### Description: 
Users can fill out important employee imformation that gets logged and generated with your new html document! Simple view it in your browser and see simple employee cards filled with thier personal information

### Installation:
run 

```npm i``` (installs node modules)

 then run
 
 ```node index.js``` (Initiates application)
 
 ###### Once the user completes the questions and fills out required fields, an HTML doc will be generated in the folder 'dist'

### Extra add-ons

###### I enjoy adding quality of life (qol) functions to assignments, time permitting. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to bring them to life on this assignment.

### Final thoughts
I liked this challenge, relitevely easy to start since we just did a similar README.md generator last week. Overall, things went smoothly starting until I started testing, I am just starting to learn testing this week and not fully confident in my skills (hence the help on code). Very simple program that generates that HTML doc with the info inputted. It's sleek and very fun to build!
